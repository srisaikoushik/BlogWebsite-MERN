# BlogWebsite-MERN
this is a source code for blogging website, made for project submission of Nodejs Workshop.  

Technologies used were:
I used ReactJs as frontend framework and Express(NodeJs) as backend framework and mongodb as database, for fetching data from backend to frotend i used "axios".  
Future Work:  
Enhance the user authentication process, adding more features like commenting the blog, likes,.. etc, and custom setup options for users.
